       <h3>Report a specific issue</h3>
       <p>If you think you have seen a scam or received a suspicious email, you can report this to us at support[at]webauto.ee. Please provide as much information as possible so we can investigate. We examine every suspicious advert and email reported to us.</p>
       <h3>Protecting your account</h3>
       <p>If you receive an email that asks you to select a link and enter sensitive information (such as your email or password), be cautious. It is unlikely any reputable organisation would do this. Webauto.ee will never ask you for your login details or other personal information in an email and we will never ask you to verify your account information by clicking on a link.</p>
       <p>If you think someone has gained access to your Webauto.ee account, change your password immediately and contact us at support[at]webauto.ee. We recommend using different passwords for your Webauto.ee account, email account and other online accounts. Never disclose your account details to anyone and always ensure your password is strong by using a combination of letters and digits, including uppercase. You should also change your password regularly.</p>
